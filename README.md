# SharedWebWork
Assessed Coursework for the Interactive Systems 3 course with Helen Purchase.

**Requirements:**

We will be using Meteor as our IDE.

To run the program simply type *meteor* into the terminal.

**TODO LIST:**
- [ ] Create .gitignore for all meteor files
- [ ] Divide tasks (front-end, back-end maybe?)
- [ ] Get meteor insatalled on lab machine




#Exercise Description from PDF


**Task:**

Design, implement and evaluate and interactive shared whiteboad to support the collaborative activity of preparing documents.

**System specification:**
* The system must be able to be used by several people in the creation of documents – the interaction must be simultaneous and distributed.
* The system should include the usual functionality you would expect from an interactive system used for creating documents.
* The system should be creative, and show evidence of imaginative design.
* The system must be implemented using javscript and node.js, although you may use additional technologies if you wish.

**Process:**
* You must include at least two rounds of formative evaluation: the first must be evaluation of your system design; the second must be evaluation of your system implementation. You may include more formative evaluations if you like.
* You must conduct a comparative summative evaluation, comparing your system with that of one other team.

**Deliverables:**
The report should include at least the following sections:
* Scenarios of use: provide at least three scenarios describing how your system might be used.
* Design: focus on the interface and the interaction design, rather than the underlying system design. Describe your initial design, your evaluation process, and your final design – justifying all decisions made.
* System implementation: focus on the interesting technical challenges of implementing the interactive features of your system. Describe your evaluation process, and subsequent changes made – justifying all decisions made.
* Summative comparison: focus on the differences in interaction and use, rather than differences in implementation. Describe your evaluation method, and write a comparative summary of the two systems.
The report must be a maximum of ten A4 single-sided pages, with a maximum of 3500 words.1

At the demonstration, you must:

* Demonstrate the system in use, with at least two participants working on a common
document.
* Demonstrate the basic essential features of the system first, before showing any
enhancements or extensions you have implemented.
* Be prepared to answer questions about the technical aspects of the implementation.
The demonstration must not take longer than five minutes, so it is a good idea to script it and practise
it in advance.

**Scope:**
The project specification is deliberately loose, to give you the opportunity to be creative and
imaginative. Here are some example usage scenarios – you are not expected to satisfy these particular
scenarios, and are expected to devise your own, but these examples will give you an idea of the scope
of what you might decide to include in your system.
* Jane, David and Paul are undergraduates working on a group assignment for Physics 101 for
which they need to conduct an experiment using a pendulum in a container of oil. They need
to collect and analyse data on the movement of the pendulum in different concentrations of
oil and submit a report for assessment. David and Paul live in Glasgow; Jane lives in Auckland.
* Mary and her family (husband Tom and teenage children Daniel and Trudi) are very involved in
organising events for the local church, whose congregation consists mostly of elderly local
residents. The church has asked the family to take over the task of advertising for the next
church fair.
* Zip Inc. provides software that enables networks of people to communicate with each other
using video, images and text. Their IT department believes that more computing resources are
needed to improve the system response time. The data team (Jo, Joe and Joh) have been
collecting data on a system use on a daily basis for three years: they want to use this data to
persuade the Board of Directors that they need more resources.
